## 🚀 Versions

### 🌐 1. Web & Mobile Edition (Portable)

Designed for smartphones and laptops. Access it through any modern browser to transform your phone into a wearable navigator.

- **Turbo Audio:** Uses Web Speech API for near-zero voice latency.
- **Smart Minimalist UI:** Zero-clutter, high-contrast mobile interface.
- **Responsive:** Adapts perfectly to portrait or landscape mobile screens.

### 🍓 2. Raspberry Pi 5 Edition (Hardware)

A standalone, high-performance offline version optimized for the Raspberry Pi 5 hardware.

- **OpenVINO Acceleration:** Leveraging the AI capabilities of the RPi 5 for near real-time object detection (~10-15 FPS).
- **Picamera2 Integration:** Native support for the modern `libcamera` stack.
- **Spatial Audio Guidance:** Directional cues provided via `espeak-ng`.
- **Zero Internet Requirement:** Fully functional offline for maximum privacy and reliability.

---

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Spatial Mapping:** Categorizes surroundings into **Left, Center,** and **Right** zones.
- **Collision Avoidance:** Detects objects in the "Center" zone and calculates the safest clearing path.
- **Proximity Alerts:** Issues high-priority **"STOP"** commands for critically close obstructions (Occupying >40% of the frame).
- **Priority Object Detection:** YOLOv8-based detection prioritizing people, vehicles, and common household obstacles.
- **Visual Feedback:** Color-coded bounding boxes for sighted caregivers or developers (optional).

## 🍓 Detailed Raspberry Pi 5 Guide

This section provides a step-by-step guide to setting up the standalone hardware version of **SEEING WITH SOUND**.

### 1. Hardware Requirements

- **Raspberry Pi 5** (4GB or 8GB RAM recommended).
- **Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3** (or compatible libcamera-supported camera).
- **Audio Output:** Standard 3.5mm jack, USB speakers, or Bluetooth headset.
- **Power Supply:** Official 27W USB-C PSU to ensure full performance during AI inference.

### 2. Operating System Setup

1. Use **Raspberry Pi Imager** to flash **Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)** onto a high-speed SD card.
2. Boot up and complete the initial setup.
3. **Enable Camera:**
   - Open a terminal and run `sudo raspi-config`.
   - Navigate to **Interface Options** > **Camera** and ensure it is enabled.
   - _Note: RPi 5 uses the modern libcamera stack; legacy camera support must be disabled._
4. **Update System:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

### 3. Installation

1. **Clone the Project:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abinanthan-CG/streamlit-auto-ocr-live.git
   cd streamlit-auto-ocr-live
   ```
2. **Run Automated Setup:**
   This script installs `libcamera-apps`, `espeak-ng`, and Python dependencies (`picamera2`, `ultralytics`, `openvino`).
   ```bash
   chmod +x pi_setup.sh
   ./pi_setup.sh
   ```
   _The script will also automatically export the YOLOv8n model to OpenVINO format for hardware acceleration._

### 4. Running the Navigator

Run the main script to start the visual-to-auditory system:

```bash
python3 pi_navigator.py
```

**Customization Flags:**

- `--freq [seconds]`: Adjust how often the system speaks (default: 1.0s).
- `--display`: Launches a window showing the camera stream and detection boxes (requires a monitor/VNC).
- `--pc-test`: Use this to run on a PC/Laptop webcam for testing without a Pi.

### 5. Performance Optimization

The system is designed to use **OpenVINO** for inference. On the first run, ensure the `yolov8n_openvino_model` folder exists (generated by `pi_setup.sh`). This reduces CPU load and increases the frame rate significantly compared to standard PyTorch inference.

## 🧠 Technical Overview

The system uses the **MobileNetSSD** deep learning model to perform real-time object detection.

**The Navigation Logic:**

- **Center Zone Blocked?** System checks Left and Right zones.
- **Left Clear?** Commands: "Move slightly left."
- **Path Clear?** Commands: "Path is clear."
- **Object too large (Close)?** Commands: "STOP! Object in front."

## 📦 Requirements

- **Python 3.9+**
- **OpenCV** (DNN Module)
- **Streamlit** (for Web Version)
- **Pyttsx3 / Web Speech API** (depending on version)
